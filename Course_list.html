                    <p class="course-description">
                        An examination of a range of advanced data structures, with an emphasis on an object-oriented
                        approach. Topics include
                        asymptotic analysis; various binary search trees, including red-black and splay trees; skip
                        lists as alternatives to
                        binary search trees; data structures for multidimensional data such as K-D trees; heaps and
                        priority queues, including
                        binary heaps, binomial heaps, leftist heaps (and/or other mergeable heaps); B-trees for external
                        storage; other commonly
                        used data structures, such as hash tables and disjoint sets. Programming projects in this course
                        will focus on
                        implementation issues for data structures and on empirical analysis of their asymptotic
                        performance.

                    <p class="course-description">
                        This course covers the design of complex computer systems making heavy use of the components and techniques discussed in
                        CMSC 313, or CMPE 212 and CMPE 310. All parts of the computer system – CPU, memory and input/output – are discussed in
                        detail. Topics include information representation, floating-point arithmetic, instructions set design issues (RISC vs.
                        CISC), microprogrammed control, hardwired control, pipelining, memory caches, bus control and timing,input/output
                        mechanism and issues in the construction of parallel processors.

                    <p class="course-description">
                        An introduction to the fundamentals of operating systems. Topics include interprocess communication, process scheduling,
                        deadlock, memory management, virtual memory, file systems, and distributed systems. Formal principles are illustrated
                        with examples and case studies of one or more contemporary operating systems.
